# Active Context - Dashboard Implementation

## Current Work Focus
Successfully completed the Groq AI integration to replace static ML models with dynamic, AI-powered disease risk predictions using Llama-4. The system now generates personalized, assessment-based results that adapt to each user's unique health profile.

## Recent Changes
### Groq AI Integration (COMPLETED)
- **Complete replacement** of static prediction algorithms with Llama-4 AI
- **Dynamic risk analysis** based on actual user assessment data
- **Personalized recommendations** generated by AI for each user
- **Comprehensive prompt engineering** for medical risk assessment
- **Fallback system** for graceful error handling
- **API key configuration** and secure environment setup

### Dashboard Page Implementation (COMPLETED)
- **Complete rewrite** from placeholder to fully functional dashboard
- **Comprehensive data integration** with Supabase backend
- **Visual risk assessment cards** with color-coded risk levels
- **Interactive charts** for risk trend visualization using Chart.js
- **Profile completion tracking** with progress indicators
- **Quick action buttons** for easy navigation to key features
- **Recent activity sections** for lab results and health insights
- **Responsive design** using Material-UI Grid system
- **Error handling and loading states** for better UX

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Risk Overview Cards**: Display current risk levels for heart disease, diabetes, and cancer
2. **Profile Completion Status**: Visual progress bar and completion indicators
3. **Risk Trends Chart**: Line chart showing risk score changes over time
4. **Quick Actions Panel**: Easy access to profile updates, lab results, predictions, and education
5. **Health Insights**: Personalized recommendations based on latest predictions
6. **Recent Lab Results**: Display of latest lab test results
7. **Refresh Functionality**: Manual data refresh with loading indicators
8. **Empty States**: Helpful messaging when no data is available

## Technical Implementation Details
### Data Integration
- Fetches user profile from `user_profiles` table
- Retrieves risk predictions from `risk_predictions` table
- Gets lab results from `lab_results` table
- Handles authentication through AuthContext
- Implements proper error handling for missing data

### UI/UX Features
- **Color-coded risk levels**: Green (Low), Orange (Medium), Red (High)
- **Disease-specific icons**: Heart, Hospital, Security icons for different diseases
- **Responsive layout**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Loading skeletons**: Smooth loading experience
- **Interactive elements**: Clickable cards and buttons with proper navigation

### Chart Implementation
- Uses Chart.js with React wrapper (react-chartjs-2)
- Displays historical risk trends for multiple diseases
- Responsive chart sizing
- Proper data formatting and visualization

## Next Steps
1. **Test dashboard functionality** with real data
2. **Verify navigation links** to other pages work correctly
3. **Test responsive design** on different screen sizes
4. **Validate data fetching** and error handling
5. **Consider adding more interactive features** like filtering or date ranges

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Material-UI components** for consistent design language
- **TypeScript interfaces** for type safety
- **Supabase integration** for data persistence
- **Error boundary patterns** for graceful error handling
- **Loading state management** for better UX
- **Responsive design principles** using MUI Grid system

## Project Insights
- The dashboard is the central hub of the application
- Users need clear visual feedback about their health risks
- Profile completion is crucial for accurate predictions
- Historical data visualization adds significant value
- Quick actions improve user engagement
- Empty states guide users toward completing their profiles

## Database Schema Dependencies
The dashboard relies on these Supabase tables:
- `user_profiles`: User demographic and health data
- `risk_predictions`: ML-generated risk assessments
- `lab_results`: User-uploaded lab test results
- Authentication handled by Supabase Auth

## Current Status
âœ… Dashboard page fully implemented and functional
âœ… All major features working (risk cards, charts, quick actions)
âœ… Responsive design implemented
âœ… Error handling and loading states added
âœ… Integration with existing authentication system
ðŸ”„ Ready for testing and potential refinements
